git clone https://github.com/Kallen15/StoreWebApplication.git

## Usage
Open project P1_KemoAllen in Visual Studio. 
Run the program. A webpage will open in your browser. (I'm using Firefox).
There are options to Login or Register a user.
Select Register. Here you will enter some user information then submit.
On the user page there are three options at the bottom.
The one that is working is "Make an Order HERE!".
After selecting "Make an Order HERE!", you can enter information about your order. However this is as far as the program goes.
